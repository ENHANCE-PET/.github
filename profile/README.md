## Our Vision 
To enable a wider adoption of fully-quantitative molecular image information in the context of personalized medicine.

## Our Mission
Advancement of basic correction and quality measures to facilitate the extraction of information and knowledge from clinical images and non-imaging information. We engage in translational research through local and international collaborations and source knowledge from multiple disciplines, including medicine, pharmacology and radiochemistry. We believe in a synergistic ‘Physician + artificial intelligence’ approach to further increase our understanding of diseases and help support clinical decision making. In particular, we focus on the novel total-body PET to probe whole-person research.
