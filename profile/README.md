## 🥼 About us
“Quantitative Imaging and Medical Physics” (QIMP) was founded in 2013. The group is associated with a full professorship for “Physics of Medical Imaging – Hybrid Imaging” at the Med Uni Vienna.

The group comprises of a variety of academic and non-academic experts who are united by the intent to provide scientific support to improving healthcare for patients. We are engaged in applied research that helps to clinically anchor the concept of personalized medicine through the use of multi-modal imaging methods.

## 🔭 Our Vision 
To enable a wider adoption of fully-quantitative molecular image information in the context of personalized medicine.

## 🚀 Our Mission
Advancement of basic correction and quality measures to facilitate the extraction of information and knowledge from clinical images and non-imaging information. We engage in translational research through local and international collaborations and source knowledge from multiple disciplines, including medicine, pharmacology and radiochemistry. We believe in a synergistic ‘Physician + artificial intelligence’ approach to further increase our understanding of diseases and help support clinical decision making. In particular, we focus on the novel total-body PET to probe whole-person research.

## 🔬 Our research interests

Exploring the landscape of human inter-organ connections.
